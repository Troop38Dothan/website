Our dear Camp Alaflo is changing. new scouts do not know what happens in camp alaflo and why changing it is a big deal. You could also say they do not know where anything is.

 Camp Alaflo has an interesting geography.  There used to be a giant hill that was painful to climb that now has a road on it. At the bottom of the hill is the mess hall and the lake. Before you go down it the alternate roads lead to campsites and the ranges. On one side of the lake there is the council fire ring while the other side has outdoor skills.


Camp Alaflo is home to many different events. The most popular is summer camp which started in 1958.  Recently more events have appeared. Klondike is where we race with sleds and complete scout skill challenges. In Weblos Weekend we show Weblos scouts what it is to be in a boy scout troop.


To finalize Alaflo has many purposes. There are many fun events including Weblos Weekend, Klondike, and summer camp. The geography of the camp makes these activities more fun. Even though our dear camp is changing for better or worse it is still our dear camp Alaflo
